# RuneHelper

A lightweight overlay tool for **Path of Exile 2** that uses **OCR (Tesseract)** to detect item names on the screen and display their current market prices.

## Features

* Select any loot area on the screen.
* Real-time OCR using Tesseract.
* Single-pass OCR tuned for the Runeshape loot menu.
* Fuzzy matching for OCR mistakes.
* Overlay displaying item prices next to detected items.
* Automatic price cache updates.
* League-specific offline price cache to reduce API requests.
* Debug window showing OCR and matching results.
* Optional OCR debug image/text dumps.
* No game memory reading or injection.

## How to use

Click **Select Region**, then drag a rectangle around the Runeshape loot list. This only needs to be done once; RuneHelper saves the selected region in its config. Select it again only if the game window, UI scale, or menu position changes.

## How it works

1. Select the loot area on your screen.
2. RuneHelper periodically captures the selected region.
3. The OCR pipeline finds text rows in the right side of the Runeshape loot menu.
4. Each detected row is cropped, binarized, and passed to Tesseract.
5. OCR mistakes are corrected using fuzzy matching.
6. Prices are loaded from cache or downloaded from the API.
7. An overlay is rendered next to the detected items.

## OCR Debug

Enable **Debug OCR** in the UI to write the latest OCR inputs and recognition logs to:

```text
Windows: %APPDATA%\Denz\RuneHelper\ocr_debug\latest
Linux:   ~/.config/RuneHelper/ocr_debug/latest
```

The folder is overwritten on each OCR run and may contain:

* `source.png` - captured source region.
* `rows_detected.png` - detected text rows and crop start markers.
* `row_XX_row.png` - detected row crop.
* `row_XX_text.png` - text crop sent to OCR preprocessing.
* `row_XX_bin.png` - binarized image passed to Tesseract.
* `row_XX_bin.txt` - raw OCR text, trimmed text, confidence, and accept/reject status.

## Dependencies

* C++20
* OpenCV
* Tesseract OCR
* cpr
* nlohmann/json
* ImGui

## Building on Windows

Installed via vcpkg:

```powershell
vcpkg install opencv:x64-windows
vcpkg install tesseract:x64-windows
vcpkg install cpr:x64-windows
vcpkg install nlohmann-json:x64-windows
vcpkg install imgui[dx11-binding,win32-binding]:x64-windows
```

## Building on Ubuntu

Linux support currently targets X11 only. Run RuneHelper from an X11 session; Wayland support is not implemented yet.

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    pkg-config \
    libopencv-dev \
    libtesseract-dev \
    libleptonica-dev \
    libblas-dev \
    liblapack-dev \
    libx11-dev
```

> **Note:** `libtesseract-dev` provides the C++ API, while `libleptonica-dev` is required by Tesseract.

### Configure and build

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build

cmake ..
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

## Price API

Prices are fetched from:

```text
https://poe.ninja/poe2/api/economy/exchange/current/overview?league=LEAGUE&type=TYPE
```

The cache is stored in the RuneHelper app data directory as a league-specific dump:

```text
Windows: %APPDATA%\Denz\RuneHelper\prices_dump_<league>.json
Linux:   ~/.config/RuneHelper/prices_dump_<league>.json
```

The dump is refreshed automatically every 15 minutes.

## Known Issues

* Linux support currently targets X11 only; Wayland support is not implemented yet.

## Disclaimer

This project:

* does **not** inject into the game;
* does **not** read game memory;
* only captures a user-selected screen region and performs OCR on the image.
